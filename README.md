Identify cancer driver genes through shared Mendelian disease pathogenic variants and cancer somatic mutations

Mendelian disease germline pathogenic variants impact functions of key proteins involved in the developmental process and consequently cause inheritable diseases. So we bring about such hypothesis: If the same germline pathogenic variants occur as somatic mutations in cancer, these mutations would also alter protein functions and may play a role in tumor initiation and progression.
